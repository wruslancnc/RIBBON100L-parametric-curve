This section briefly summarizes the characteristics of selected parametric curves in this work. The details are provided in the subsequent pages.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Teardrop} - Closed loop, Overall Single loop, Reflection x-axis: non-symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: symmetrical
	\item \textbf{Butterfly} - Closed loop, Overall Multiple loops, Reflection x-axis: non-symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: symmetrical
	\item \textbf{Ellipse} - Closed loop, Overall Single loop, smooth convex curves, Reflection x-axis: symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: symmetrical
	\item \textbf{Skewed-Astroid} - Closed loop, Overall Single loop, 4 cusps and 4 concave curves,	Reflection x-axis: symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: symmetrical
	\item \textbf{Circle} - Closed loop, Overall Single loop, smooth convex curves, Reflection x-axis: symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: symmetrical
	\item \textbf{AstEpi} - Closed loop, Overall Three loops, all convex curves, Reflection x-axis: non-symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: non-symmetrical
	\item \textbf{Snailshell} - Open ended curve, Overall No loop, smooth and continuous convex curves, Reflection x-axis: non-symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: non-symmetrical
	\item \textbf{SnaHyp} - Open ended curve, Overall 1 loop, except for 1 concave curve, the rest are convex curves, Reflection x-axis: non-symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: non-symmetrical
	\item \textbf{Ribbon-10L} - Open ended curve, Overall Single loop, smooth convex curves, Reflection x-axis: non-symmetrical,
	Reflection y-axis: non-symmetrical
	\item \textbf{Ribbon-100L} - Open ended curve, Overall Single loop, smooth convex curves, Reflection x-axis: non-symmetrical, Reflection y-axis: non-symmetrical
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{In subsequent pages,} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the top region provides the parametric representation of the curves in terms of x(u) and y(u).  
\item the lower left figures give the overall x and y sizes of the curves. 
\item the lower right figures provide the color-coded feedrate profiles as the machine traces (cuts) through the parametric curves.
\end{enumerate}
