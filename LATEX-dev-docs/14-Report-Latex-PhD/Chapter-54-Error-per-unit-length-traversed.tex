\section{Error per unit length traversed}

This section briefly describes the chord-error per unit length traversed in the point-to-point parametric curve interpolation algorithm.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{error/length} - The rightmost column in data tables presented in subsequent pages shows the calculated chord-error per unit length for all parametric curves in this work.
	
	
	\item \textbf{User specified Feedrate Command FC} - In subsequent pages, five(5) data tables are presented, one each for FC10, FC20, FC25, FC30 and FC40, also for the calculated chord-error per unit length of all parametric curves in this work.
	
	\item \textbf{Order magnitude error/length} - Notice that the calculated chord-error per unit length for all parametric curves in this work is in the order of 1E-6 and 1E-5, where 1E-6 is the specified chord-error tolerance, irrespective of the user specified feedrate command.
		
	
	\item \textbf{Histogram for all parametric curves} - Also in subsequent pages, five(5) histograms for the calculated chord-error per unit length are presented, one each for the parametric curves in this work.
	
\end{enumerate}
