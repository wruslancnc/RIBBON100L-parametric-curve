\section{Results Feedrate Profile}

This section briefly describes the results of the feedrate profiles for the ten(10) different parametric curves generated by the algorithm. The color-coded feedrate profile is one of the most important validations of the algorithm for parametric curves.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Never exceeding the user specified feedrate command} - In all cases of parametric curves, the User Feedrate Command FC was never exceeded by the current feedrate for the entire range of u-points.
	
	\item \textbf{Smoothness in feedrates} - the x-axis and y-axis feedrates displayed smoothness for the entire range of u-points.
	
	\item \textbf{Color-coded feedrate transitions} - When the parametric curve is being displayed using the feedrate color codes for its (x(u),y(u)) points, the path trace shows smoothness in feedrate color transitions.

\end{enumerate}
