\section{Total Interpolated Points}

This section briefly describes the results on the total number of interpolated points generated by the algorithm for five(5) different user specified feedrate commands (FCs).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{FC10} - User Feedrate Command = 10 mm/s
	\item \textbf{FC20} - User Feedrate Command = 20 mm/s
	\item \textbf{FC25} - User Feedrate Command = 25 mm/s
	\item \textbf{FC30} - User Feedrate Command = 30 mm/s
	\item \textbf{FC40} - User Feedrate Command = 40 mm/s
\end{enumerate}

The results are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The total number of interpolated points generally decreases as the User Feedrate Command (FC) increases. 
	\item This means that as you increase the feedrate, you have less interpolated points to cover for the same distance traversed.
	\item The algorithm executes in a manner that strictly abides by the four(4) defined constraints, mentioned earlier.
\end{enumerate}
