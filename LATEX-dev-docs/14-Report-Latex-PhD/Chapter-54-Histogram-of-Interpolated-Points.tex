\section{Histogram of Interpolated Points}

This section briefly describes the histogram of the total interpolated points for FC10, FC20, FC25, FC30 and FC40, in the point-to-point parametric curve interpolation algorithm for all parametric curves in this work. The histogram are presented in subsequent pages.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Histogram x-axis display} - The x-axis for the histogram provide the 10-bins for the entire range of u-points from u=0.0 to u=1.0.
	
	\item \textbf{Histogram y-axis display} - The y-axis for the histogram provide the total interpolated points for the five(5) user specified feedrate commands (FC10, FC20, FC25, FC30 and FC40)
	
	\item \textbf{Histogram for all parametric curves} - In subsequent pages, ten(10) histograms for the total interpolated points are presented, one each for the parametric curves in this work.
	
	\item \textbf{Correct expectation} - As expected, the general trend is that the total interpolated points decreases as the user specified feedrate command increases. Essentially the chord length grew longer as the feedrate is increased.
	
	\item \textbf{Constraints} - It is important to note that in all cases, the four(4) mandatory algorithm constraints C1, C2, C3 and C4 are never compromised.
