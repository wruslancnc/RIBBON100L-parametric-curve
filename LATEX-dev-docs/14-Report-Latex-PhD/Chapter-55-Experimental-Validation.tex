\section{Experimental Validation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The experimental validation is work-in-progress.

\item This section briefly describes the hardware setup and tests carried out on the hardware for the execution of point-to-point parametric curve interpolation algorithm.

\item The execution of the RS274/NGC g-codes generated on the fly by the parametric curve interpolation algorithm has been conducted on the hardware setup using the LinuxCNC Axis ver 2.8.0 software application. It was successful and displayed all the expected feedrate characteristics.
